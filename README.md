# Computer Systems Projects
The three most significant projects I worked on as part of my computer systems class. They include:

1. [the Northeastern Shell (nush)](nush/README.md)
2. [The Northeastern Memory Allocator (numalloc)](numalloc/README.md)
3. [The Northeastern Filesystem (nufs)](nufs/README.md)

## Usage
Clone the repo to get started, then checkout each project to learn more!
